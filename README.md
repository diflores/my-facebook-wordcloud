# My Facebook Wordcloud
I did this very simple notebook during the night of July 13, 2016, just because I wanted to visualize my most frequently used words.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK for stopwords
- Matplotlib for showing the wordcloud.



## Future work

Since I just remembered I had done this little project, I'll try to make a version for making a wordcloud for any given user.
